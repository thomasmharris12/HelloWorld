# HelloWorld
This is a general begining for ideas and projects.
I am new to coding and to GitHub, so I am trying to learn new skills to further my professional development.  
I come here to to aid in my also new Arduino adventures.
I hope to learn many new skills that will help me build a secure and comfortable future for me and my family.
